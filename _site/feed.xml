&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes:&lt;/strong&gt; Process and Planning, Strategy, Technology, Entrepreneurship&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Our team was tasked with developing a venture pipeline of fintech businesses to be grown as arms of the more established company. We were tasked with everything from identifying ideas that had merit, creating plans to build technology, and developing revenue models and go to market strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-innovation-hub-trying-to-find-its-footing&quot;&gt;An Innovation Hub Trying to Find its Footing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TNB, The National Bank, had made huge strides in technology while also keeping their core products moving forward at a conservative pace. This strategy served them well, but they realized to create true innovation — from organizational culture to the tech stack — even the location of the offices needed to change to attract a different kind of talent. The bank, however, still needed to remain at arm’s length. Finlabs, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was created to focus solely on the creation of new financial products and services with the plan to have half of those spin out into separate legal entities, and the other half to go back into the bank and enrich its current offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first six months were primarily scaffolding activities: putting the right policies and procedures in place to adhere to all the regulatory requirements that go along with being owned by a financial institution. The team grew to about 15 people made primarily of designers, engineers, and operational support staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-landscape&quot;&gt;Understanding the Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping into an organization in its infancy, many of its policies and procedures were more cultural norms than anything else: “The Finlabs Way,” as the management team liked to say. Entire structures of the organization were trapped in individuals’ heads, but it didn’t take long to get a high level sense of the motivations of the team and the strategy of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug, the CTO, had an enterprise background. He worked and managed large teams of engineers at places like Google. Despite this, or maybe because of the culture at large tech firms, Doug was very connected to the startup culture. He read most of the typical start-up stomping grounds like Hacker News and StackOverFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug’s main focus was security. As a part of a large financial institute — a conservative one at that — being responsible for the security of the tech stack made him nervous. When he wasn’t overly stressed about code and data, he mostly was interested in how the team could take on a more “start-up” approach, or more accurately, a start-up culture. He constantly spoke in terms like passion and hunger. But despite his start-up mentality, his trepidation around the tech stack slowed the pace of development, which was at odds with the pressure from the bank to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren, the COO, didn’t have much experience in tech- nology or product. It seemed like the “messy” process, the ambiguity, and the spikey nature of the work made her anxious. She was quick to build full scale processes, which made sense, considering she went from the 50,000 person mothership to a 13 person satellite. Her biggest concerns were that the company wasn’t generating enough business ideas. Despite her lack of experience in technology and innovation, she was the manager for the venture arm of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the strategic interests of the leadership team, I had conversations with everyone on the venture team. The venture team was tasked with generating ideas and developing them to the point where the startup idea could be presented to the board of Finlabs for funding. This team was comprised entirely of business professionals with MBAs and finance backgrounds and felt the pressure from the entire C-suite to find the “next big thing.” The primary output of their work included Powerpoint slide decks with financial forecasts, macro-economic factors that might influence the business ideas, and potential competitive advantages against other firms in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-culture-for-idea-generation&quot;&gt;No Culture for Idea Generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked how many ideas had been developed in the 18 months the firm had been operational. They pointed me to a Box folder. I presumed there would be between 100 and 500 in various forms. In my head, ideas were cheap, and having start-up and design experience I subscribed to the “fail fast, fail often” mentality. Most of those 100 to 500 ideas would be bad, but hopefully I would find some groupings of concepts and perhaps be able to build off those as a foundation. What I found was that over the course of a year the team of three had a list of 12 ideas and no paper trail of thinking aside from lengthy PowerPoint decks that seemed to be too much tree and not enough forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked what the team’s cadence was. There didn’t seem to be any standing meetings, no deadlines, no goals, no specific project initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-new-routines--rituals&quot;&gt;Creating New Routines &amp;amp; Rituals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, organizational challenges or lack of innovation require time to re-frame the problem space. We get caught in the pattern of looking at problems as the sums of their parts. Design allows us to divide problems and their solution spaces, not just by division of a whole into a set of parts, but by viewing the problem/solution space from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way of dividing a problem/solution space creates new ways to tackle complex problems. The Wilcox Williams library of re-framing tools helps to unravel the complexity of problem spaces in new ways. Exploring several of our in-house heuristics for the challenges at Finlabs, Routines &amp;amp; Rituals seemed most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the top-of-the-funnel problem was as much a cultural problem as it was a functional one. The firm was created to generate new businesses from within. The staff was equal parts business, product, and engineering, and yet the business end was wholly responsible for generating concepts. That team would sit quietly and work in their silos, not taking advantage of what the designers or engineers could contribute. In addition, the tone of the office felt dry. People had their heads down in their laptops and the unstructured meetings focused on PowerPoint decks instead of artifacts that could spark innovation. To the CTO’s point, if this were a start-up, there would be “passion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rituals inspire. They can create a space and time where individuals seek to contribute as opposed to sitting quietly. They create a mindset that is out of the ordinary day-to-day flow of meetings, emails, and decks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to both the culture issue as well as the lack of idea generation ended up being a ritual — a party. We called it Pitch Fest. The concept was simple: each week the entire company would hear pitches from employees of new business ideas — served up with beer. The group had concerns about the quality of ideas, the amount of time it would take to realistically describe ideas in a rhetorical fashion to the rest of the company, and also what would become of the ideas afterwards? Their questions were pragmatic and I didn’t have answers to all of them, but I reassured them that building a culture of idea generation could go a long way, even if most of the ideas didn’t. And furthermore, it was important to prototype the event and iterate on it — the design way. While the company culture was risk-averse, nobody objected to giving it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Pitch Fest happened less than a week later. We engaged other parts of the organization for broader participation and audience feedback. Five new business concepts were pitched — they were fresh, daring, and still very much in their infancy. But most importantly, ev- eryone enjoyed the spirit of the event and felt energized for the first time in months. Through iteration, we also realized that two minutes for an idea with two minutes of questions felt right. We didn’t know what the next step should be but we had more new ideas in one afternoon than the team had produced in months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-cadence-and-routine&quot;&gt;Creating a Cadence and Routine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During any kind of innovative problem solving or project development, the whole solution rarely materializes in the beginning. Sometimes you don’t even know step two until you’ve finished step one. After the first Pitch Fest, we were unsure if the problem was going to be a lack of ideas, a lack of company engagement, or a lack of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, the question that arose from the client was “now what?” Management had done a great job of recruiting the COO from a large financial institution, the CEO had experience in Silicon Valley start-ups, the CTO was from Google, and the Head of Product from IDEO. The ‘now what’ was to lean on the expertise of the group but with the structure of routines and rituals that ensured ideas could lead to launched businesses with the best thinking in tech, design, management, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week, the Idea Advocate (the employee who pitched it) would talk about the prior week’s progress and would advance the idea with one guiding question for each area: tech, business, design, and operations. The team didn’t need to have a pre-planned step two. The team needed to realize that each idea had its own unique next steps — visioning, prototyping, market analysis, user research, or a combination of those things. This was a team essentially tasked with creating the future and no pre-set plans could compete with the already rich set of values, vision, and experience from the leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months later, the team had doubled in size and received additional funding to launch three new com- panies within the year. Several other fun events have spawned out of Pitch Fest such as a company-wide competition of Microsoft Excel skills, hack-a-thons, and a makerspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitch Fest not only helped to create a meaningful ritual that fostered an open dialogue between employees, it has also become a successful recruiting and advertising event: potential hires and stakeholders from within TNB are regularly scheduled to visit the offices during Pitch Fest as it’s seen as a highlight of each week. Beyond Pitch Fest, the importance of cadence and a particular type of energy and idea expression has permeated the culture of FinLabs. Each quarter, the business team “pitches” ideas to a set of external advisors. And now, throughout the organization, PowerPoint decks that were typically informational have morphed into pitches themselves: they exhibit risk, fresh ideas, and narratives of new future states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code snippets like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var foo = &quot;bar&quot;;&lt;/code&gt; can be shown inline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this should vertically align&lt;/code&gt; &lt;del&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;with this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;and this&lt;/del&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code can also be shown in a block element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;var foo = &quot;bar&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code can also use syntax highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Javascript&quot;&gt;var foo = &quot;bar&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Javascript&quot;&gt;var foo = &quot;The same thing is true for code with syntax highlighting. A single line of code should horizontally scroll if it is really long.&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Code&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Javascript&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var foo = &quot;bar&quot;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ruby&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foo = &quot;bar&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small images should be shown at their actual size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://placekitten.com/g/300/200/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is the final element on the page and there should be no margin below this.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes:&lt;/strong&gt; Internal Service Design, Operations, Project Management, Process and Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scoping&quot;&gt;Scoping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assignment was to develop a template for design projects. The client was a design firm of 35 people, and would have small teams of 2 to 5 people work projects, but there was no consistent process moving from business lead to contract through completion. A template would allow there to be a unified checklist, making sure a few tasks were always completed, no matter what the project, and it could also be a working document that the teams used to move towards completion. The first step in one of my organizational projects, after all of the contracts are signed, is scoping the project. This project was not only a complex beast of information, procedure, and people, but it also existed in a larger context, the design firm itself and branched off into HR, Sales, and Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main contact for this project, let’s call him John, walked me through what he thought I should do and who I should interview to get a better sense of the problem. John explained that the design firm was split into &lt;em&gt;Business People&lt;/em&gt;, User Centered People, and Graphics People. The Business People brought in the work, they wrote up the contracts, they had meetings with clients. Then the User Centered People put the most hours into the actual projects, which were 3 months to several years. And that whole time, the Graphics People were there helping to document every step of the process. John figured that it would be helpful if someone looked at all the steps of that process, from finding a client, to negotiating, to creating a project with a budget and milestones and due dates, and then creating a template that the Business People could follow. Being an outsider with a three month contract, it seemed like a job for someone else, but I had the full support of John and a couple other high level folks, so I started a bit of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tommy&quot;&gt;Tommy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy is the youngest of the Business People. I was probably pointed in his direction because he was low on the totem pole and noboby wanted to take billable hours away from top people. Tommy walked me through the typical project. Someone in the design firm knows someone in another company. They get to talking, and at some point realize that it might be a good idea to work together. The sales guy at the design firm starts tracking progress with this company. He starts figuring out if the project is the right size, if the design firm has the resources for it, if the firm has the skills. At some point a proposal is written up, usually by a Business Person that loosely outlines a bit of work. Then there’s a meeting with the other company’s management team and one of the Business People in the design firm where more details of the project are fleshed out. Another project proposal is written up with more detail, some User Centered People and some Graphics People get assigned to the project, and the Business Person manages the client and the team throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I felt like I had a rough sketch of the process, and wanted to learn more about the information systems that were used to track all these moving parts. The Sales Guy had a hardcore excel setup to track sales progress and expected revenue per month. Each project had a row in the spreedsheet, and each column had an amount for a month in the future. This way, the design firm could estimate how much revenue it would have per month based on project estimates. So if a project was 100,000 dollars split over 10 months, each month would be 10,000 of revenue, but there was also a probability rating to determine if the project would actually happen based on signatures and past experience with the client, and that probability rating would be multiplied by the revenue. This was a forcasting device to help the company plan. Everyone in the company with billable hours used an online tool for tracking how much work they did for each project. So there as one system for forcasting, and one system for keeping track of the present state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;/images/second-road-current.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy thought that if there was a project proposal template, with check boxes, that would go a long way. There already seemed to be a fair amount of tracking, but not much planning. He thought this could be a living document that would move with the project, and even suggest weekly meetings between the Business Person and the rest of the project team. A checkbox could be something like “Did you check with the head of the graphics team to make sure they have the resources to take on this project?” or “Schedule a weekly meeting with the User Centered People who are a part of the project to check on their hours and milestones”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sarah&quot;&gt;Sarah&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah was the head of the Graphic Designers. Apparently each group (Business People, User Centered People, and Graphics People) had a head, but it seemed like in some groups, this was just a sign of seniority and didn’t come with any power, just more non-billable hours and more pay. Sarah wasn’t like that though. Everyone in her group looked to her for mentorship, and she single handedly assigned designers to different projects based on experience, interest, and aptitude for learning. Sarah seemed frustarted with the way projects were run at the Design Firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphic design was an after thought. Instead of being a part of the conversation with Business People when putting together a project proposal, Sarah seemed to be relegated to putting out aesthetic fires, and could never take the time to properly plan out how people on her team were delegated to projects. If the Business People consulted her on a project while writing up the proposal, she would have a better understanding of the type of work, the amount of work, and who on her team would be most suited for the job. The Business People had no idea how much time it took to create a beautiful final report, and continually under estimated the level of effort for graphic design work. Of course this attributed to projects going over budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Sarah why she didn’t look at the excel document with revenue projections for each project coming down the line, and I infered from her attitude, it was either wrong for her to look at the numbers of the business, some cultural standard, or she didn’t understand how to read the document, or possibly that she felt she was too busy putting out fires. By this time, I started having a good idea of the timeline of projects and a few pain points within the process. It seemed like having a project template would not only codify a process, but it would also make sure the right people were involved. Instead of thinking of the document as just a list of tasks, it could be thought of as a tool to bring siloed groups of people together–a document that is for discussion and not individual use. I was getting excited, a possible solution was forming, but I still had no idea if that was the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, Sarah told me something that blew my mind. “Oh yeah, we made one of those a year ago”. She said it so matter of factly, that it took me aback. She went on to pull up some massive documents showing the stages of projects, listing groups of stakeholders to be included. The project template even suggested a weekly meeting between the design team and the Business Person, which I thought was a great idea. “Me and Frank and Tommy all spent about 3 months working on this system.” Tommy was a business guy that I had already talked to who didn’t even mention this, and Frank was a member of the user research team, and now that Sarah had run out of time, Frank was next on my list of interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;/images/second-road-past.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;frank&quot;&gt;Frank&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You see all those people who have their own laptops? Well they all came into
the company when it was just a bunch of independent contractors.” Frank was
giving me the history of the company. It confused me to think of 3 people in a
company spending 3 months on a project template that nobody used. Why wasn’t it
used? Who authorized it just to let it die after hundreds of hours had been
poured into it. Frank was explaining that most of the older guys (and I do mean
guys, as there were zero women), most of the people in the business group, used to be independent contractors and really just want to do billable work and be left alone. Frank explained that since the organization was completely flat, it was hard to get people to do anything. He mentioned that there had been several attempts to get everyone on the same page in project planning, and even attempts at codifying proposals that went out to prospective clients had been dismissed. It seemed like older people had power just because they were older, and since there really weren’t any promotions or job titles built into a hierarchy, it was hard to displace that cultural power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cranking&quot;&gt;Cranking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there I was, at the bottom of the totem pole of power, with three weeks left in my contract, assigned to get everyone in the org to work projects a little better. I knew that there was a problem at the onset of projects, when a project was formed the right people were not at the table, and I knew that because of that poor planning, projects were burning faster than they should, and because no one was checking on projects, things could get really bad before anyone noticed. The hardest part for me at the time was figuring out what the final product was going to be. If you’re hired to make a website, or a chair, or a planned event you know that going in. I was brought in to make a project template of sorts, but after many conversations, and armed with the evidence that this approach had been taken before and didn’t work out so well, I was given some flex on what kind of widget to design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there seemed to be a strong culture that pushed aside attempts at structural overhead or structural anything, I decided to take advantage of this. Instead of creating something and trying to get people to follow it, I could create something that would push everyone in the org to be more open about their project process and progress. There was a system that projected the revenue of the firm, and there was a system that recorded hours. I ended up hacking together a system that combined the two. If a project was supposed to burn through 100k in four months, and after 2 months, the project had burned through 60k, then the project was burning too fast. The Business Person managing the project should know about this, the design team should adjust their hours, and the rest of the organization should try to help out in any way it could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of creating openess lead to a visual interface that showed
projected cost of each project, where the project should be (in this case,
around 50k) and where the project currently was (in this case, 60k) in a place
that couldn’t be avoided… the kitchen. Everyone went into the kitchen multiple
times a day. It was a place for informal conversation and socializing. The
concept was that if everyone in the organization new that Tommy (for example)
had a project that was 10k over-spent, Tommy would work hard to fix that, and
that the organization would do a better job of self regulation through instant
feedback. I considered the project a success in a single moment. After three
weeks of HTTP Requests and Perl code (yes, I actually coded it, and yes in Perl), I walked over to the CFO’s office and showed her a chart of every single project currently going on. She asked one question “Why is that one red?”, I answered, she set a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There is one situation that all designers, at least this designer, loves and fears at the same time–working for another designer.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Solving Community Security with More Community, Not More Security</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2015/05/23/community-space-key-policy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Solving Community Security with More Community, Not More Security" /><published>2015-05-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2015/05/23/community-space-key-policy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2015/05/23/community-space-key-policy.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem: More Access = More Problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my &lt;a href=&quot;http://catapultpgh.org&quot;&gt;coworking space&lt;/a&gt; gets larger, the space has been left open more often than I’d like. Some people suggested an alarm system or keyless entry system, some others suggested two membership tiers, a cheaper level without a key to the space, and a more expensive level with a key to the space–this would reduce the number of people with keys, hopefully increasing security. Aside from doors being left unlocked, there has been a growing concern of too many unknown/unvetted people around. The sense of security might be somehow related to a ratio of known versus unknown people in a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the type of feeling I’m trying to promote, so there needed to be a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-i-didnt-choose-an-alarm-system&quot;&gt;Why I didn’t Choose an Alarm System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have cameras in a space, or even sensors, you’re giving off a particular signal. When you walk in to a bank that has plate glass, you see what I mean. Also, I feared the only change would be instead of members using the door lock incorrectly, we’d have members using the alarm incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-i-didnt-choose-to-reduce-the-number-of-keys&quot;&gt;Why I Didn’t Choose to Reduce The Number of Keys&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the worse decision to make is associating trust with money. It seems like a subtle mental shortcut we make all the time. People with money must be more trustworthy… People can pay for trust. That would only mean that an outsider who wants to rip off the community would need 150usd instead of 50usd to get 20 macbook pros and a couple iMacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, reducing the amount of keys isn’t a long term solution. If we want to grow as a community, we need &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; access not less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also also, by having different levels of access, there needs to be more “keeping track”, and lists, and things I’m just generally not interested in doing/maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;someone-already-had-the-solution&quot;&gt;Someone Already Had the Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is new, and for a lot of inspiration on how to run a work community, I look to Alex Hillman at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indyhall.org/&quot;&gt;IndyHall&lt;/a&gt;. He decided to put the responsibility of deciding who to trust back on the community. In his &lt;a href=&quot;http://dangerouslyawesome.com/2014/07/the-neighborhood-watch-method-for-coworking-space-security/&quot;&gt;Neighborhood Watch&lt;/a&gt; method, each new member has to get approval from several others to get a key.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="community" /><summary type="html">Problem: More Access = More Problems</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Web Services Versus Mac Server</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2015/02/28/web-services-vs-server.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Web Services Versus Mac Server" /><published>2015-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-02-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2015/02/28/web-services-vs-server</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2015/02/28/web-services-vs-server.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-motivations&quot;&gt;Original Motivations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like one of my favorite types of procrastination is saving small recurring amounts of money. Despite the fact that a single dinner out costs more than any one of the web services I pay for, I still enjoy spending hours at night trying to save 7 dollars a month. To that effect, I’ve moved my VPS from Linode to Prgmr to Digital Ocean chasing 3 to 4 dollars of monthly savings and spending hours in the process migrating servers. I’ve done the same with my online backup setups, going from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/&quot;&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; to Arq over Amazon S3 and back again. But then I realized that there is only but so much optimization in reducing spending on web services one at a time, and also realized that &lt;strong&gt;sometimes solving 4 problems is easier than solving one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;financial&quot;&gt;Financial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list of services most likely looks pretty standard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cost  Services          Use               Server Replacement
----  --------          ---               ------------------
5     Digital Ocean     VPS               I now ssh into my iMac
5     BackBlaze         offsite backup    BTSync to mirror
1.7   iTunes Match      music             Plex from iMac
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent 800 dollars for a 2011 iMac. This machine is actually slightly faster as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks&quot;&gt;geekbench&lt;/a&gt; than my 2013 13” macbook pro. So it will take 3 years to pay off the iMac from savings in services. But, I ended up selling my 27 inch monitor back to my coworking space for 300 dollars, which means I will be able to pay off the iMac in 22 months instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I tried slightly harder, I’m sure I could find replacement for Hulu Plus and instapaper speeding up the process even more, but with a 22 month pay off, in addition to other benefits, I’m more than satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-benefits&quot;&gt;Other Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My desk is now much much cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have to take a bag to work. This is actually bigger than I thought. The feeling of walking to work untethered is pretty amazing after an entire life of backpacks and messenger bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redundancy&lt;/strong&gt; is a great benefit. I have a dead pixel on my macbook pro, and it’s not going to be an issue even if it needs to be sent away for a week since I’ve got an ipad and iMac to hold me over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;depreciation-path&quot;&gt;Depreciation Path&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the one to two years of this machine being my main work machine, I’ve already thought out other areas it could be useful. When it’s too slow for Photoshop, I could put this computer in my bedroom and have it be my night time media center. Just put [Plex][plex] into full screen mode and call it a day. After the processor is so slow it can’t run whatever beyond 4k idiocy we’re watching in the future, I can turn the machine on in &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT3924&quot;&gt;Target Display Mode&lt;/a&gt; and run it as an external monitor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Original Motivations</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Starting a Coworking Space Doesn’t Have to Be Hard</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2013/01/09/starting-a-coworking-space-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Starting a Coworking Space Doesn't Have to Be Hard" /><published>2013-01-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-01-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2013/01/09/starting-a-coworking-space-doesnt-have-to-be-hard</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2013/01/09/starting-a-coworking-space-doesnt-have-to-be-hard.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-the-people&quot;&gt;Getting the people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a grant from a local non-profit that allowed me to open a co-working space for one month. This grant included enough for rent, and that was about it. After one month, I had 12 people signed up and ready to go. After that landlord raised the rent by 50 percent, and after waiting to find a new space, I had 6 members left (it took 4 months to find a new home). This step isn’t that necessary, if you have people, get a space, if you don’t have people, don’t get a space. I started with only 6 people. If you built it, more will come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were the first tenants in a space, 5139 Penn Ave., in the Garfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. We’re on the same block as an art community space, a co-operative music venue, and an awesome pizza shop. The space isn’t the prettiest, but we’ve got 2000 square feet for about 1000 a month in rent, and the building is so well made that we’re paying less for heat than my one bedroom apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1800 dollars for first and last months rent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;500 for 10 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50121453/&quot;&gt;Ikea Vika Amon Tables&lt;/a&gt; and legs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;500 for 10 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99884539/&quot;&gt;Ikea Jules Swivle Chairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100 for several tables and chairs I scraped from craigslist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 for donated coffee grinder and chemex, utensils, dorm sized frig&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;24 for 3 makeshift whiteboards (go to home depot and by 8’x4’ shower stall walls)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15 for whiteboard markers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;60 for cloth hand towels (we have the cleaning girl wash and fold each week)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;600 for gas and electric deposits. This was an unexpected cost, apparently even if residents don’t have to leave deposits, businesses do. These were paid gradually over the first year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the first year we paid ourselves back the complete initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show-n-Tell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each month we have 4 speakers who are doing cool projects around town, from electronic instrument making, to tool lending libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro Loans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have partneredairs and tables as we kept filling seats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;re-occuring-costs&quot;&gt;Re-occuring Costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;900 for rent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100 for internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100 for cleaning lady&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200 for electric&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;100 for gas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;65 for coffee subscription&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;35 for water subscription&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1500&lt;/strong&gt; Total&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;membership-doesnt-have-to-be-hard-either&quot;&gt;Membership doesn’t have to be hard either.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we use freshbooks to send out monthly re-occuring invoices. All expenses are handled with freshbooks as well. Since we don’t set hard limits on days in the office, we don’t need any way to track or reserve. If we start getting too many part-timers, we’ll just buy more tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-upcoming-year&quot;&gt;The Upcoming Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally would consider the first year of &lt;a href=&quot;http://catapultpgh.org&quot;&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt; a success. My goal was to break even and pay myself back, and I did that. In addition, there are a million intangible benefits such as waking up each morning and getting to work in an awesome community of motivated people, being able to trade/barter services, learning Clojure, getting instant design critiques and instant design/code help, and offering just as much as I’m getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I don’t really know where this is going to go. Honestly, I feel like I’m not in control of it either. I always dream of getting a new building and shooting out an email to Catapult saying something like “hey guys, got this sweet new building for us, we’re moving two blocks down in the next 3 months” and then getting a unanimous response “that’s cool, we’ll stay here”. That would never happen, but the nagging image just reminds me that I’m not completely in control of where this group goes. We’re a community, and although I can foster and cultivate, I cannot really direct. I’m just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; lever on the machine. I am thinking of moving in with an artist friend and her cooperative of artists, thinking of rolling my own design work into the Catapult umbrella and turning this thing into a super ad-hock full stack design shop, but those are just dreams. We’ll see what the next year brings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Getting the people</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pittsburgh Coffee Shop Rankings</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/coffee/2012/12/24/pittsburgh-coffee-shop-rankings.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pittsburgh Coffee Shop Rankings" /><published>2012-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/coffee/2012/12/24/pittsburgh-coffee-shop-rankings</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/coffee/2012/12/24/pittsburgh-coffee-shop-rankings.html">&lt;p&gt;This was a post a made on &lt;a href=&quot;http://nevertellmetheodds.org/t.php?id=120685#3483158&quot;&gt;nevertellmetheodds.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voluto was better before commonplace bought it. they had 49th parallels which were just better beans, even if they didn’t do the best job with them. I theorize that commonplace is not that good because everyone smokes and can’t taste food anyway. As far as rankings, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beans&quot;&gt;beans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Marty’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Marty’s Market has coava coffee right now. Coava is out of portland, they have direct relationships with farms, they roast some coffee especially for espresso, and they only do single origin. their beans are hit or miss, but when they nail it, it’s amazing. Go when Kira is working, tell her Elliott sent you, ask for an espresso and she will actually care about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. 21st Street&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
21st street uses inteligentsia. I feel like they used to be the best, but lately I feel like I’m not in love with the way espresso turns out. Big Dog in the south side and a few other places also use their beans, but if only buy beans in the other shops, the staff isn’t nearly as knowledgeable as at 21 but I’ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Espresso a Mano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Espresso a Mano uses ritual. These guys are out of LA or SF I can’t remember. The shop out there seemed full of dbs, but their beans are pretty good. These beans are second teir compared to Coava and Intelli, but they are priced accordingly and I think a good value. Actually a really good value if you can’t afford the really good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Tazz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tazz uses Counter Culture. As you can see they are fourth on my list, but honestly get an espresso from Tazz and you won’t be that sad. They do a damn good job with what they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Common Place&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There might be someone who roasts who is better, but I don’t know. They are everywhere you are, kelly’s, Common Place S.H. Voluto, Geet or whatever it’s called, probably in a bunch of restaurants. These are probably the best local beans you can get. Better than 19 or Zeek or any other. They are the best local, but still they are fifth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n. La Prima&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
La Prima (keep in mind this is bean quality), Crazy Mocha, Starbucks, Coffee Tree, etc. I want Coffee Tree to be good. The guys that own that place seem to care about coffee a lot, but for some reason it doesn’t trickle down through the staff and into my cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;staff-knowledge-and-skill&quot;&gt;Staff Knowledge and Skill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. 21st Street&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to learn about coffee go here. They are the best, and if you go to another shop (Espresso a Mano, Marty’s) cough cough, they might be trained by someone at 21. Ask a question here and get a legit answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Marty’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Commonplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;n. here and below I think it’s a wash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pour-over&quot;&gt;Pour over&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. 21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Pour overs don’t just take skill, they take taste buds. I would say more so than espresso. Marty’s I think just doesn’t have the bandwidth for pour overs, that’s cool, it will be a long time before they match up with 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Honestly, if you want a pour over just go to 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;espresso&quot;&gt;Espresso&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. 21 (anytime) and Marty’s (when Kira’s working)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I say this because 21st street is consistent as all hell. But even a blind squirrel can find a nut and in the case of marty’s, if you put great beans together with good equipment and someone who gives a damn you can’t go too far astray. I’ve been going to 21 for years and rarely have I had a bad shot. I’ve been going to Marty’s since they opened and maybe their average shot isn’t as good as 21, there have been a few that got me genuinely excited about espresso again. Maybe it’s just that 21/intelli has such a signature flavor profile, maybe it’s just that it’s new, but damn good espresso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.Tazz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Seriously. They don’t have a Syneso, they don’t have amazing beans, but just go get one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n. It’s all a wash below these three spots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will say that Big Dog is particularly bad. They espresso are more like old school longo or whatever those italians used to call them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-in-summation&quot;&gt;So in summation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I buy Coava beans, get espressos at 21 and Marty’s and pour overs at 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ve pissed off tons of people and I’m sure I’ve left out places like lillies or cat and dog or that convenience store that has 50 cent caps on butler. If I left out any place, it’s probably because they’re dirt. But just because I think it’s dirt doesn’t mean it is, and I never said there was anything wrong with dirt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="coffee" /><summary type="html">This was a post a made on nevertellmetheodds.org:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Always Give Cyclists the Same Advice</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2012/08/16/i-always-give-cyclists-the-same-advice.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Always Give Cyclists the Same Advice" /><published>2012-08-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-08-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2012/08/16/i-always-give-cyclists-the-same-advice</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2012/08/16/i-always-give-cyclists-the-same-advice.html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a new law in PA to increase the safety of biking in cities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whereas&lt;/strong&gt; Catapult PGH possess a bit of space and am choosing to share it with you, The Person in Need of Space, with the mutual understanding that we are both cool and that you will not be a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manners of being a jerk include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using more than your fair share of amenities (electric, water, bandwidth, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allowing your noise/stuff/smell/detritus to encroach on common spaces, or the space of others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything that would lead to permanent damage of the premises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Parties agree that the Person in Need of Space shall lease from Catapult PGH in the premises located at 5139 Penn Ave. PGH PA 15224 on the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term&lt;/strong&gt;. The Term of this Agreement shall continue as long as the Parties are cool with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rent&lt;/strong&gt;. The Person in Need of Space will pay a total of $&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;__ per month. Rent will be payable on the first day of each month directly to The Organization Taking the Fall if Anything Happens.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Eat anything you left behind, even if it is non-edible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about what a jerk you are on whatever current social network is most important to you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write a haiku about your mom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination&lt;/strong&gt;. Termination of this agreement can be executed by either party, but don’t be a jerk, give some notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are acknowledging and agreeing to this document by reading it. If you find any part of this agreement uncomfortable or confusing, don’t sweat it.  If you can follow the spirit of the document, and not be a jerk, I’m sure we’ll get along fine.&lt;/p&gt;
