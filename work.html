	<h4 class="font-alt">From a Product to a Platform</h4>
	<p>We worked with an Ed Tech start-up from day one, guiding everything from product strategy and interfaces to hiring and team structure. By sharing a Slack channel, we could help with nuts and bolts during the day and spent our weekly meetings to focus on the bigger picture.</p>

	<p>We used natural language processing to accelerate legal contract review and management. What mattered for most was building out a sophisticated user experience that respected the high level of expertise of users to empower them rather than replace them.</p>
